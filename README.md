# Eat all the Burgers
## UW Bootcamp Week 14 Homework

Remember all of those times that you wanted to keep a list of all of the burgers you wanted to eat, then mark them complete or 'eaten'? Well, this is the application for you!


## Homework Instructions
In this assignment, you'll create a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). Be sure to follow the MVC design pattern; use Node and MySQL to query and route data in your app, and Handlebars to generate your HTML.

## How to access it
This application is hosted in Heroku! The front-end experience can be found here: [https://peaceful-falls-58995.herokuapp.com/](https://peaceful-falls-58995.herokuapp.com/)... and no, I didn't pick the domain name. 

If you'd like to see the action behind the scenes, check out the github repo: [https://github.com/TammyLeeSeattle/burger.git](https://github.com/TammyLeeSeattle/burger.git).
